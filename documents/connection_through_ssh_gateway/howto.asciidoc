Connecting using a SSH gateway
==============================

To connect to Jean Zay, in addition to your username creation you had to give an
IP address you will be connecting from.  In some cases, this will be the address
of the SSH gateway used by your laboratory.  This short documentation explains
how to make things easier.

== Connecting with SSH

You have to “jump through” your gateway to have access to Jean Zay.  You can put
that into your `~/.ssh/config` file (replacing the things between `<>` by the
actual values of course):

```SSH
Host jz
  HostName jean-zay.idris.fr
  User <your IDRIS username>
  ProxyJump <your username on the gateway>@<the address or name of your gateway>
```

Then, you can then connect directly to Jean-Zay with `ssh jz`.

== Displaying the notebooks

IDRIS has a proxy system to display the notebooks running on the computing
nodes as explained into
link:http://www.idris.fr/jean-zay/pre-post/jean-zay-jupyter-notebook.html[their
documentation].  This proxy is only reachable by your connection IP address.  To
do that it's easy to use your gateway as a proxy.

On Firefox (why would you want to use anything else?) you can use the
extension

Standard].

Once installed, it will add an icons ① on your toolbar. Clicking on it will open
a little window on which you can click on “Options” ② to add ③ a new proxy
setting.

Give a pretty name ④, select `SOCKS5` as proxy type ⑤, use `127.0.0.1` as proxy
address ⑥ and `8888` as proxy port ⑦. Also switch to not sending DNS queries
through the proxy ⑧.

Then, as we don't want all the traffic to go through the proxy, do “Save & Edit
Patterns” ⑨.

Replace the “all IPs” pattern.  Give a friendly name ⑩, use `idrvprox.idris.fr`
as pattern ⑪ and save ⑫.

Then, you can ask to only use the proxy by pattern ⑬.  Doing this, only your
HTTP traffic to the IDRIS proxy will use your SOCKS proxy while your other
connections (you might need to use search engines while coding...) will be
direct.

Before connecting to the IDRIS proxy for notebooks, you will first need to
connect to your gateway creating the SOCKS proxy with `ssh -D 8888 -N <your
gateway>`.  This will not launch a login shell, keep the command running while
you are working and kill it with kbd:[CTRL + C] when you have finished.

You will then have access to https://idrvprox.idris.fr/.
